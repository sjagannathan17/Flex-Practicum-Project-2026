## 1. Prerequisites (Install These First)

You need **three things** installed on your computer before anything else.

### A. Python 3.10 or higher

**Check if you already have it:**
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should see `Python 3.10.x` or higher. If not, install it:

- **Mac:** Open Terminal and run:
  ```bash
  brew install python
  ```
  Don't have Homebrew? Install it first: https://brew.sh (paste the command from that page into Terminal)

- **Windows:** Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/ — **IMPORTANT:** Check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

### B. Node.js 18 or higher

**Check if you already have it:**
```bash
node --version
```
You should see `v18.x.x` or higher. If not:

- **Mac:**
  ```bash
  brew install node
  ```
- **Windows:** Download from https://nodejs.org/ (choose the LTS version)

### C. Git

**Check if you already have it:**
```bash
git --version
```
If not installed:

- **Mac:** It will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools. Click "Install".
- **Windows:** Download from https://git-scm.com/downloads

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

Open your Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjagannathan17/Flex-Practicum-Project-2026.git
```

Then navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd Flex-Practicum-Project-2026
```

> **Where does this go?** It creates a folder called `Flex-Practicum-Project-2026` in whatever directory you ran the command from. If you want it on your Desktop, first run `cd ~/Desktop` (Mac) or `cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop` (Windows) before cloning.

---

## 3. Set Up API Keys

The app needs API keys to work. You need to create **two** environment files.

### A. Backend API Keys (Required)

Create a file called `.env` inside the `backend/` folder:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item backend\.env.example backend\.env
```

Now open `backend/.env` in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad, TextEdit) and replace the placeholder values:

```
# REQUIRED - Get from https://console.anthropic.com/
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE

# OPTIONAL but recommended - Get from https://brave.com/search/api/
BRAVE_API_KEY=BSA-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE

# Leave this as-is
SEC_USER_AGENT=CapExIntel/1.0 (your-email@example.com)
```

#### How to get the API keys:

| Key | Where to get it | Cost |
|-----|-----------------|------|
| **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** | Go to https://console.anthropic.com/ → Sign up → Go to "API Keys" → Create Key | ~$20-50/month usage |
| **BRAVE_API_KEY** | Go to https://brave.com/search/api/ → Sign up → Get free API key | FREE (2,000 queries/month) |

> **Ask the team lead** if you don't want to create your own keys — they can share the existing ones.

### B. Frontend Environment (Required)

Create a file called `.env.local` inside the `frontend/` folder:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001" > frontend/.env.local
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
"NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 frontend\.env.local
```

That's it for frontend — it just needs to know where the backend is running.

---

## 4. Backend Setup (Python)

From the project root folder (`Flex-Practicum-Project-2026/`), run:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

> **This will take 3-5 minutes** the first time because it downloads AI models and dependencies (~1 GB).

**If `pip` doesn't work**, try:
```bash
pip3 install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

**If you see permission errors**, try:
```bash
pip install --user -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### Optional: Use a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment keeps project dependencies isolated. This is recommended but not strictly required.

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

> **Remember:** If you use a virtual environment, you need to activate it every time you open a new terminal to work on the project:
> - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
> - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
>
> You'll know it's active when you see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

---

## 5. Frontend Setup (Node.js)

From the project root folder, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

> **This will take 1-2 minutes** the first time. You'll see lots of output — that's normal. As long as it doesn't end with `ERR!`, you're fine.

---

## 6. Build the ChromaDB Vector Database

The app uses a vector database (ChromaDB) to search through SEC filings. This database is NOT included in the repo (it's ~570 MB), so you need to build it locally.

> **Note:** This step only needs to be done **once**. It takes about 15-30 minutes depending on your computer. You can skip it initially if you just want to explore the UI — the app will work but queries won't return document results.

**Before running this**, make sure the company data folders (`Flex/`, `Jabil/`, `Celestica/`, `benchmark/`, `Sanmina/`) are present in the project root. They should already be there from cloning.

From the project root folder:

```bash
python3 "Vector Database/build_chromadb.py"
```

You'll see output like:
```
======================================================================
  MULTI-COMPANY CAPEX — CHROMADB EMBEDDING PIPELINE
======================================================================
  Loading embedding model (all-mpnet-base-v2)...
  ✓ Model loaded (768-dim vectors)

  Scanning company folders...
  📂 Flex         → 27 files
  📂 Jabil        → 84 files
  📂 Celestica    → 77 files
  📂 Benchmark    → 111 files
  📂 Sanmina      → 106 files
  ...
```

Wait until you see `✅ ChromaDB ready for all companies`.

> The script automatically finds the company data folders relative to the project root. No path configuration needed.

---

## 7. Running the Application

You need **two terminal windows** running at the same time — one for the backend, one for the frontend.

### Terminal 1: Start the Backend

Open a terminal, navigate to the project root, and run:

```bash
python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

**Wait until you see output like this:**
```
✓ Embedding model pre-loaded
✓ ChromaDB connected: 19050 documents
✓ Scheduler started for automated SEC filing checks
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001
```

> **Leave this terminal running.** Don't close it.

### Terminal 2: Start the Frontend

Open a **second** terminal window, navigate to the project, and run:

```bash
cd Flex-Practicum-Project-2026/frontend
npm run dev
```

**Wait until you see:**
```
  ▲ Next.js 16.x.x
  - Local: http://localhost:3000

  ✓ Ready in Xms
```

> **Leave this terminal running too.** Don't close it.

---

## 8. Verify Everything Works

### Step 1: Open the App
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

You should see the app's main page.

### Step 2: Check the Backend Health
Open a **third** terminal (or a new browser tab) and go to:

**http://localhost:8001/api/health**

You should see something like:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "chromadb": {
    "connected": true,
    "documents": 19050,
    "companies": {
      "Flex": 3200,
      "Jabil": 5100,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

If `"connected": true` and documents > 0, everything is working.

### Step 3: Test the Dashboard
Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**

You should see analytics charts and company data.

### Step 4: Test the Chat
Go to: **http://localhost:3000/chat**

Try asking: *"What is Flex's capital expenditure for 2024?"*

You should get an AI-generated response with data from SEC filings.

This is a Swagger UI where you can test every API endpoint directly.

---

## 10. Stopping the Servers

Press `Ctrl + C` in each terminal window to stop the servers.

---

## 11. Daily Workflow (After Initial Setup)

After the first-time setup, here's all you need to do each time you work on the project:

```bash
# 1. Open Terminal, navigate to the project
cd Flex-Practicum-Project-2026

# 2. (If using virtual env) Activate it
source venv/bin/activate       # Mac/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows

# 3. Start backend (Terminal 1)
python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# 4. Start frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

---

## 12. Pulling Latest Changes

When someone on the team pushes updates, pull them:

```bash
cd Flex-Practicum-Project-2026
git pull origin main
```

Then reinstall dependencies in case they changed:

```bash
# Backend
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

Restart both servers after pulling.

## 14. Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `python3: command not found` | Install Python. On Windows, try `python` instead of `python3`. |
| `pip: command not found` | Try `pip3` instead of `pip`. Or use `python3 -m pip install ...` |
| `node: command not found` | Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ |
| `git: command not found` | On Mac, accept the Xcode prompt. On Windows, install from https://git-scm.com/ |
| `brew: command not found` | Install Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` |
| Permission denied errors | Add `--user` flag: `pip install --user -r backend/requirements.txt` |
| `npm ERR! code ERESOLVE` | Try: `cd frontend && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install` |

### Backend Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xxx'` | Run `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` again |
| `No module named 'backend'` | Make sure you're running the command from the **project root** folder, not from inside `backend/` |
| `Address already in use (port 8001)` | Another process is using that port. Kill it: `lsof -i :8001` then `kill <PID>`. Or use a different port: `--port 8002` |
| `ChromaDB connection failed` | You haven't built the database yet. See [Step 6](#6-build-the-chromadb-vector-database) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` | Check that `backend/.env` exists and has your key. Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign |
| Backend starts but chat doesn't work | Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` is valid and has credits |
| `Embedding model failed to load` | First run takes a few minutes to download the model (~400 MB). Make sure you have internet. |

### Frontend Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm install` fails | Delete `frontend/node_modules/` and `frontend/package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again |
| Page shows "Failed to connect to backend" | Make sure the backend is running on port 8001 in a separate terminal |
| Blank page / nothing loads | Check browser console (F12 → Console tab) for errors. Usually means backend isn't running |
| Port 3000 already in use | The frontend will automatically try port 3001. Check the terminal output for the actual URL |
| CSS looks broken | Run `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` |

### ChromaDB Build Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `No files found` | Make sure you're running the script from the project root (`Flex-Practicum-Project-2026/`) |
| `Skipping [company] — not found` | Some companies might not have all subfolders. This is OK — it processes what it finds |
| Script is very slow | Normal — it's embedding ~400 documents. Takes 15-30 minutes on most machines |
| `OutOfMemoryError` | Close other applications. The embedding model needs ~2 GB RAM |

### General Tips

- **Always run commands from the project root** (`Flex-Practicum-Project-2026/`), not from subfolders
- **Backend must start before frontend** — the frontend needs the backend API to be available
- **Restart both servers** after pulling new changes from git
- **Check the API docs** at http://localhost:8001/docs for testing endpoints
- **Browser cache** can cause issues — try hard refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+R` on Windows)
